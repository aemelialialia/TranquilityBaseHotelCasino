  storyText: "You looked back and see the wailing ghosts that you've been hanging
    out with. Realizing that this might be the only one who's ever considering this,
    you accepted the deal. You looked over the devil's shoulder and see Mark smiles
    and gives you a nod. You took the bone key, and all a sudden, the guests in the
    feast starting to materialize and you are starting to fade. With the eternal rule
    of this hotel, you control the gateway between life and death, until you found
    another guest to make the deal with you.\r\n"
