  storyText: 'Upon cracking the code, you handed the piece of paper to Mark downstairs.
    Mark said nothing, only turned around and started looking for something in the
    key cabinet. After a long sigh, he handed you a key, which has your name etched
    on it. You took the key and sprinted to the gate of the hotel. You ran and ran,
    and never looked back. '
