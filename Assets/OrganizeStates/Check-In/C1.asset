  storyText: "You followed Mark, walking into this grandeur of elevator lobby. You
    marvel at the beauty and the antiquity of this hotel. After Mark closed the elevator
    sliding door, they went up three floors. As they approaches the mahogany door,
    you put down your bags and hear Mark sighs, \"Oh no, not again. I forgot your
    keys. Let me go down and grab them. I'll be right back. Don't move!\" As he runs
    downstairs, grabs an old-fashioned bronze key from the key cabinet. Runs back
    upstairs.\r\n"
