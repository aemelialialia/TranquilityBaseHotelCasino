  storyText: "You walk into a buildling that's probably the tallest building in this
    deserted village. You have travelled far to get here and you think you have made
    enough progress in your journey to settle and rest in this hotel. You walked in
    with your light luggage to see this place is very well furnished and probably
    a little grand for you, but since you have no other choice, you decide to get
    a night of rest in this place - \"Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino\".\n\nAs soon
    as you walked in, you're greeted by the receptionist. \n\"Welcome to Tranquility
    Base Hotel and Casino. I am Mark, I will be your host and butler for your entire
    stay. \""
