  storyText: '"I''m running from the police. I''ve done something terrible." You remembered
    the night you broke out of prison.

    The figure stares into your eyes, looking surprised. "I didn''t expect you to
    tell the truth so quickly. So I guess you have experienced your personal hell
    - the prison? Well I can promise you that this is way different. A lot of... tranquility...
    goes around here." The figure looks around. He held our his hand to you. In his
    palms, there is a token for the casino downstairs. "Go to the feast, find the
    other token that pairs up with this. You still have hope." Then he disappeared,
    leaving you the token. '
