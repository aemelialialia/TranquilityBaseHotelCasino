  storyText: He says, "Haha nothing much, just getting very bored in this room of
    mine. You see, I don't want to be here, but I have done something bad so I have
    to be here for the rest of my existence to find a replacement for myself. And
    you happen to be here. I see you are a very... um.... boring person, and you haven't
    done anything bad. I have no reason for you to replace me. But again, I really
    don't have to have a reason." He shrugged.
