  storyText: "You look down into the trash can to realize that the paper you threw
    in are gone. You think you're going crazy.\r\n\"Shame.\" A voice said. You turn
    around and see a figure behind you standing by the window.  \"I couldn't imagine
    how much you don't care about things around you.\" The figure is approaching you.
    \"That was your only ticket out of here, since you have given it up. I have no
    choice but to keep you. My friends told me that you're not the ideal choice, but
    oh well...\" The figure took a deep breath and stepped into the light. You see
    a well-dressed, middle-aged man standing in front of you, his mustache and speech
    reminds you of The Great Gatsby. "
