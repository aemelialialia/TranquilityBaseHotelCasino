  storyText: You reached the casino and realized that there are a lot of guests who
    have already arrived. It is curious how such a small hotel can hold that many
    guests. People are rather dressed up and walking around, as if you're in Las Vegas.
    A waiter approached you and ask if you want any drinks.
