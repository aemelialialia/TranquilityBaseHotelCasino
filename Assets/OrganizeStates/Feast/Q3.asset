  storyText: 'Excited by the man''s proposition, you want to know what he has to say
    next, it''s better to keep yourself enetertained. "Sure, let''s see what you got."
    You say. The casino doors shut close behind you. The people who were happily playing
    games suddenly stopped to look at you, you realized that they''re not humans.

    The old man pulls out a golden key. "This is not to my chocolate factory, unfortunately."
    He says, "but this might be the best deal you''ll ever get. You see, I am getting
    old. Look at these souls around you, they used to be good people, people like
    you, come to here for refuge, but this hotel kept them here forever."'
