  storyText: "You tipped Mark. He shows gratitude. And you are very curious about
    the feast, so you ask him, \"so what is this feast that is going to happen tomorrow?\"\r\nMark,
    looking surprised, maybe it's because he just told you what it is about, continues
    to explain the feast, again.\r\n\"You are lucky enough to catch our annual feast
    that celebrates the founding of Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino. There will
    be food, games in the casino and music. You will also meet other guests. There
    may be a surprise game for all the guests with a surprise prize!.\""
