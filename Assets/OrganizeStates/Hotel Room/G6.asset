  storyText: After a long sleep, you wake up to a fresh morning with the sun shining
    into the window. You just realized that the floor is not carpeted, which is kind
    of nice. You get out of bed to realize it's actually around 5pm. So where did
    the lights come from? You walked towards the window and see a giant billboard
    across the street. That explains it.
