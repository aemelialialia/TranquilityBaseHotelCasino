  storyText: "You thought about tipping Mark, but you think you can tip him later,
    so you left the idea. But you're still curious about the feast. So you ask, \"so
    what's going to happen in the feast?\"\r\nMark, looking surprised, maybe it's
    because he just told you what it is about, continues to explain the feast, again.\r\n\"You
    are lucky enough to catch our annual feast that celebrates the founding of Tranquility
    Base Hotel and Casino. There will be food, games in the casino and music. You
    will also meet other guests. There may be a surprise game for all the guests with
    a surprise prize!.\""
