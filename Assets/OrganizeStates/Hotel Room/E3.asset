  storyText: "You tipped Mark, he shows gratitude. Then you proceed to ask him about
    the history of the hotel, because the small window rooms and the interesting interior
    structure of the hotel spiked your curiosity.\r \"Very good question, sir. This
    hotel was used as a nursery for orphaned girls in the late 1800s. But then it
    was closed down. So our owner, bought the property and turned it into a hotel.\"
    \r \"Interesting. Why did the nursery closed down?\" You said.\r\n\"I don't know,
    sir. It's late, I better leave you to rest.\" Mark abruptly answered and left
    the room."
